    <div class = "firststep"> <h2>Navigation <h2>
        <p>Navigation should be easy to cover the entire page without going too much into details. The first 15 seconds is how we impress users. </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "firststep"> <h2>Hierarchy <h2>
        <p> Keep the hierarchy of the page at a minimum.  Focus on "less is more". </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "firststep"> <h2>Color <h2> 
        <p>Make a subtle color for the background that does not interfere with the main text. Every colored word should have links to other page. 
             </p>

        <h2>Principle 1</h2>
        <p>1. Make the Main Actionable Targets Easy to Reach</p>
        <p>It is important for the distance and size of a target element to directly impact the amount of time it takes for a user to navigate to and interact with it. This means youâ€™ll want to make your main actionable targets easy to reach.
            Additionally, if you have multiple targets, there should be enough space between them.</p>

        <h2>Principle 2</h2>
        <p>2. Keep Users' Choice to a Minimum</p>
        <p>This principle removes clutter and show your users only the most essential options they need.</p>

      <div class="principle">
        <h2>Principle 3</h2> 
        <p>3. Place Related Elements in Common Areas</p>
        <p>This principle states that if elements on a page are grouped together closely, they are perceived as connected to one another. </p>
